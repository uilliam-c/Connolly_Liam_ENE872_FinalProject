# Rationale and Research Questions
According to the online database, from which I collected my data, juvenile 
loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) move around frequently. Due to their 
juvenile phase of life, they are highly mobile yet, what isn't known is how or 
why they move to certain places in different seasons or ocean regions. 
From a spatial perspective, we don't have answers. Being able to identify where 
and when these turtles move/are found can help better understand their habitats.
It would be awesome to discover "hotspots" of more concentrated turtle presence 
as that may guide additional ecological analyses in the future. With the data 
available, it should be possible to assemble a general sense of the spatial 
patterns these loggerheads exhibit.

The background of this dataset relies on using satellite tracking locations
where each record present is indicative of a geo-referenced observation of a 
juvenile loggerhead. Each record comes with latitude/longitude, an individual 
identifier (series_id), and a timestamp (date_time). It is likely the dataset
will include repeated observations from the same loggerhead over the course of
the study (2002-2005), the data is still relevant for basic analyses. I will be 
focusing on examing seasonal distribution and spatial concentration for the 
loggerheads. Finally, the data contains a location "class" code (classitem) and 
some precision fields to help evaluate the patterns of data quality.
